Decentralized Voting System
This project is a decentralized voting system consisting of three integrated components: a blockchain smart contract for secure voting logic, a backend server for data management and interaction, and a frontend web application for user interaction.

Project Overview
The decentralized voting system enables users to create and participate in transparent, tamper-proof elections. Votes are recorded on the blockchain via smart contracts, ensuring security and immutability. The backend handles user management, authentication, and serves as a bridge between the frontend and smart contract. The frontend provides a simple and intuitive UI for voters and administrators.

Features
Blockchain-based voting with Solidity smart contracts

Voter registration and authentication

Create, manage, and finalize elections

Cast and count votes securely on-chain

Real-time election status updates

Responsive and user-friendly web interface

Project Structure
Smart Contract
Contains Solidity contracts for election creation, voter registration, vote casting, and tallying.
Located in /smart-contract.

Backend
API server handling authentication, user management, and contract interaction.
Located in /backend.

Frontend
React-based web app providing the user interface for voters and admins.
Located in /frontend.

Technologies Used
Solidity, Foundry for smart contract development

Node.js, Express.js for backend API

Web3.js or Ethers.js for blockchain interaction

React.js for frontend

Ethereum-compatible blockchain (e.g., Goerli testnet or local Ganache)

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+)

npm or yarn

Hardhat or Foundry

Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)

Local blockchain environment or testnet access

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd decentralized-voting-system
Install dependencies:

bash
cd backend-main
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install
cd ../smartContract
npm install
Configure environment variables (e.g., RPC URLs, private keys) in .env files for backend and frontend.

Deployment
Compile and deploy smart contracts using Foundry.

Start backend server:

bash
cd backend-main
npm start
Start frontend application:

bash
cd frontend
npm start
Usage
Register or login as a voter or admin.

Admins can create new elections and manage voters.

Voters can view active elections and cast votes.

Election results are verifiable on the blockchain.

Testing
Smart contracts: Run tests from /smart-contract using Hardhat/Foundry:

bash
npx hardhat test
Backend: Use Jest or preferred testing framework.

Frontend: Run React testing library tests as configured.

Roadmap
Add voter anonymity features

Integrate more comprehensive KYC and identity verification

Support more complex election types (ranked choice, multi-winner)

Deploy on mainnet or decentralized L2 solutions
